# ‚úàÔ∏è Transport Wing Selector ‚Äî AI-Assisted Wing Design

An **AI-driven design tool** that automates 3D wing generation from a 2D airfoil and optional polar data.  
The system evaluates 160 candidate wings using a trained **multilayer perceptron (MLP)** selector model and returns the best geometry based on your chosen aerodynamic objective:
- **min_cd** - minimize drag  
- **max_cl** - maximize lift  
- **max_ld** - maximize lift-to-drag ratio  

It converts a traditionally slow, intuition-based process into a transparent, interpretable, and reproducible workflow‚Äîdelivering optimal wing geometries in seconds.

---

## üöÄ What This App Does
- **Generates** candidate 3D wing geometries from a user-provided 2D airfoil (.dat/.txt)  
- **Scores and ranks** each design across lift, drag, and efficiency objectives  
- **Selects the top candidate**, visualizing it as:
  - A **static PNG** rendering  
  - An **interactive 3D model** (Plotly viewer)  
  - A downloadable **CAD-ready STL file**  
  - A structured **JSON summary** of aerodynamic and geometric parameters  
- **Validates** the best wing using strip-theory sweep plots (lift, drag, efficiency)  
- **Explains** results through a grounded **LLM summary** comparing the top design with close alternatives

---

## üß† How It Works
1. **Input:** Upload your airfoil geometry (and optional polar data).  
2. **Objective:** Choose your design target (min_cd, max_cl, or max_ld).  
3. **Candidate Generation:**  
   The MLP model evaluates 160 deterministic wing geometries parameterized by span, taper, twist, and chord vectors.  
4. **Selection & Visualization:**  
   The top-scoring wing is rendered as an interactive 3D mesh and validated with strip-theory sweeps.  
5. **Explanation:**  
   A lightweight language model summarizes why this candidate performs best, grounding the response in numerical features like span, taper, aspect ratio, and score.  
   Example:  
   > ‚ÄúThe chosen wing achieves high efficiency by combining a long span, moderate taper, and strong negative washout, lowering induced drag while maintaining lift.‚Äù

---

## üí° Why It Matters
Traditional wing design can take **hours per concept**, requiring manual setup, XFOIL/QBlade runs, and iterative CFD.  
This app reduces that to **under one minute**, enabling:
- Faster concept iteration  
- Reproducible, data-driven decisions  
- Transparent model reasoning through structured explanations  
- Easy export for further CFD or CAD analysis  

The workflow empowers engineers, students, and researchers to rapidly explore the early design space while maintaining aerodynamic interpretability.

## üß≠ How to Use
1. Upload your **airfoil** file (`.dat` or `.txt`) and optionally a **polar** file.  
2. Choose an optimization **objective**.  
3. Adjust parameters (Top-k slider, deterministic mode, AoA sweep).  
4. Click **‚ÄúFind Best Wing.‚Äù**  
5. View results, export files, and read the **AI-generated design explanation.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview
- **Selector Model:** MLP trained on 500+ generated wings, each labeled with aerodynamic metrics (CL, CD, L/D)  
- **Validation:** Deterministic scoring and strip-theory consistency checks  
- **LLM Wrapper:** Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, constrained via structured JSON prompt to prevent hallucination  
- **Deployment:** Gradio app on Hugging Face Spaces with STL/JSON export pipeline
