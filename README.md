# ‚úàÔ∏è Transport Wing Selector ‚Äî AI-Assisted Wing Design

An **AI-driven design tool** that automates 3D wing generation from a 2D airfoil and optional polar data.  
The system evaluates 160 candidate wings using a trained **multilayer perceptron (MLP)** selector model and returns the best geometry based on your chosen aerodynamic objective:
- **min_cd** ‚Äì minimize drag  
- **max_cl** ‚Äì maximize lift  
- **max_ld** ‚Äì maximize lift-to-drag ratio  

It converts a traditionally slow, intuition-based process into a transparent, interpretable, and reproducible workflow‚Äîdelivering optimal wing geometries in seconds.

## üöÄ What This App Does
- **Generates** candidate 3D wing geometries from a user-provided 2D airfoil (.dat/.txt)  
- **Scores and ranks** each design across lift, drag, and efficiency objectives  
- **Selects the top candidate**, visualizing it as:
  - A **static PNG** rendering  
  - An **interactive 3D model** (Plotly viewer)  
  - A downloadable **CAD-ready STL file**  
  - A structured **JSON summary** of aerodynamic and geometric parameters  
- **Validates** the best wing using strip-theory sweep plots (lift, drag, efficiency)  
- **Explains** results through a grounded **LLM summary** comparing the top design with close alternatives

## üß† How It Works
1. **Input:** Upload your airfoil geometry (and optional polar data).  
2. **Objective:** Choose your design target (min_cd, max_cl, or max_ld).  
3. **Candidate Generation:**  
   The MLP model evaluates 160 deterministic wing geometries parameterized by span, taper, twist, and chord vectors.  
4. **Selection & Visualization:**  
   The top-scoring wing is rendered as an interactive 3D mesh and validated with strip-theory sweeps.  
5. **Explanation:**  
   A lightweight language model summarizes why this candidate performs best, grounding the response in numerical features like span, taper, aspect ratio, and score.  
   Example:  
   > ‚ÄúThe chosen wing achieves high efficiency by combining a long span, moderate taper, and strong negative washout, lowering induced drag while maintaining lift.‚Äù
